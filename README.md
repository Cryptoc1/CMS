# CMS
A very small 'Content Management System' written in Python

## What is the purpose of CMS?
CMS was a project I created when learning MySQL and building data systems

## Features
* CLI for interacting with Posts table in customizable Database
* Post content is written in an .md file and is loaded into the database
* All data is stored in the database, so you don't have to protect the loaded .md files after generating a post
* Easy to use library (CMS.py) that contains functions to interact with Posts table in a customizable Database
* Minimal dependencies (5) that are installed by default

## Testing and Usage
CMS was built on Ubuntu 14.04 and hasn't been used or tested on any other systems. System functions (`os.system('clear')`) within the source were written with Linux in mind.

## What stage is development in?
CMS is in development, but won't be released for 'professional use'.
